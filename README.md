# Machine Learning Exercise with Pure Python & Numpy

## Introduction

In this exercise, we will implement a simple machine learning algorithm from scratch using Python. Models will only be
Implemented using Pytorch(For Transformers only) and Numpy(rest of models)

I hope you can learn what is going on inside the model and how it works. I will try to explain the code as much as possible.
